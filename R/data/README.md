# Placeholder files

Due to the large size of some files, I have included just placeholders so that you can visualize the structure of the project.

Files which are meant to be used in the DL pipelines or further processing are stored in `./Final`.

- `./source_SV`. Files available at <https://snp-seek.irri.org/_download.zul>, under "3K RG Large Structural Variants release 1.0 (tar.gz)".
- `./output_CNV`. Output files of 06_CNV-processing.sh.
- `./utility`. *info_* files of 02_info-of-SVs.R.
